# Basic genetic algorithm

This code is based on a YouTube tutorial from Code Bullet.
The files run through the app Processing, a Java-based IDE.

The project covers initial setup of a population, including population size and variance.
There are multiple "class" files that contain objects used to manipulate the population, such as inheritance and crossover, random mutation, and, of course, natural selection or fitness.

Simply put, this project uses a genetic algoritm to enable objects to make their way to a goal.
